# WebButtonSimpelGUI

# Project Description

This project is a simple GUI application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It consists some buttons, each associated with a different action. Clicking on Button 1 opens Google in the default web browser, Button 2 opens YouTube, and Button 3 opens GitHub (just for example).

The project demonstrates how to create a basic GUI application using Tkinter and how to handle button clicks to perform specific actions such as opening web pages. The icons for the buttons can be customized by providing the respective image paths or URLs.

To run the project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Tkinter and Pillow) and execute the script. The main window with the buttons will appear, allowing you to interact with the application.

Feel free to clone or download the repository and modify the code according to your requirements.
