##  Wait for Pull Request to merge

##  Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!

```py
'''
Always make more then 4 pull requests.
Lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects is not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get digital-swags.
I will recommend you to make pull request to your own repo which is very very safest side for you..
keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest topic..
