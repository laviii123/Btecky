# You are given a matrix, and you need to return the boundary elements of the matrix in a clockwise manner. The matrix is represented as a 2D array, and you need to extract the elements on the outermost layer of the matrix, moving clockwise.

# To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

Check if the matrix has only one row or one column. If it does, return all the elements in that row or column.
Otherwise, iterate through the top row, rightmost column, bottom row (if there are more than one row), and leftmost column (if there are more than one column) in a clockwise manner.
Add each element encountered during the traversal to the result list.
Return the result list as the boundary elements.
Here's a Python code snippet to implement this solution:

def boundaryTraversal(matrix, n, m):
    result = []

    if n == 1:
        return matrix[0]
    elif m == 1:
        return [row[0] for row in matrix]
    else:
        # Traverse the top row
        result.extend(matrix[0])

        # Traverse the rightmost column
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            result.append(matrix[i][m - 1])

        # Traverse the bottom row
        result.extend(reversed(matrix[n - 1]))

        # Traverse the leftmost column
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            result.append(matrix[i][0])

    return result

The boundary traversal starts with the top row, then moves to the rightmost column, then the bottom row, and finally the leftmost column, forming a clockwise boundary.

# Output 

1 2 3 4   8            12
        7 6 7 8   12   11   5
        11 15 16 15 14   10
13       14   13 9     4

So, the output is 1 2 3 4 8 12 16 15 14 13 9 5.
