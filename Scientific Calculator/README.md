# C++ Scientific Calculator

This is a simple command-line scientific calculator program written in C++. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations and several scientific functions.

## Features

- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- Exponentiation: Calculate the power of a number.
- Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent.
- Logarithmic Functions: Natural logarithm (ln) and Exponential (e^x).
- User-Friendly: Clear instructions and user prompts.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Choose an operation:
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (*)
   - Division (/)
   - Exponentiation (^)
   - Square Root (sqrt)
   - Sine (sin)
   - Cosine (cos)
   - Tangent (tan)
   - Natural Logarithm (log)
   - Exponential (e)
4. Depending on the operation, enter a second number or additional details.
5. The program will display the result of the calculation.
6. You can choose to continue using the calculator or exit.
