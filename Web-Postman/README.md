## Web Postman
A simple Web version of Postman. 
User interface that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing the users to create and save simple HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses. It can make various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST and saving environments for later use, converting the API to code for various languages like JavaScript.

## Optimizations
While improving this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. Adding more HTTP methods like PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
   2. Display success and error messages
   3. Adding a confirmation box to confirm parameter deletion
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned about different HTTP methods like GET, POST and PUT.
My learning was focused on creating a user interface that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. This is done by allowing the users to create and save simple HTTP/s requests, as well as read their responses.
