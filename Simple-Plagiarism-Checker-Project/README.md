# Simple-Plagiarism-Checker

Web application of Plagiarism Checker using Python-Flask. TF-IDF and cosine similarity is a very common technique. It allows the system to quickly retrieve documents similar to a search query. Similarly, based on the same concept instead of retrieving documents similar to a query, it checks for how similar the query is to the existing database file. 

## Steps:
1. User enters a query
2. Query gets processed (Uppercase to lowercase, Removal of punctuationmarks, etc.)
3. Calculations are done (Term Frequency, Cosine Similarity)
4. The Plagiarism Percentage is returned on the web page

## Python-Flask
1. Flask is a light-weight web framework for Python
2. Easy to  work with (Same syntax as of Python)
3. While Flask addresses itself as a "micro-framework", it is not lacking in features or power, especially with a clutch of extensions to support features such as authentication, databases and so on
4. Comprehensive documentation available
